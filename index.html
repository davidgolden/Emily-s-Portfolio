        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <p>I’m Emily Golden (alias E.A. Bowie), and <b>I believe that stories change the world</b>. In fact, I’m
            convinced they’re all
            that does. I’ve spent the last decade helping activists, business owners, and writers find and hone their
            voices in order to
            move hearts, change minds, and inspire action. </p>
        <p><b>As a developmental editor and book coach</b>, I provide expert guidance to help fiction writers define and
            shape their stories with Golden May Editing. There’s nothing more persuasive than a universal truth
            delivered through
            characters deep enough that they feel real. I help writers discover their truths and translate them into
            words that resonate
            with their audiences.</p>
        <p><b>As a graphic and web designer</b> at Ugly Duck Studio, I help visionary businesses and organizations reach
            those
            they wish to serve. Storytelling is an incredibly powerful branding, marketing, and sales tool—especially
            when it’s authentic, resonant, and beautifully delivered.</p>
        <p><b>As a fiction writer</b>, I use epic fantasy to comprehend the world. The first book of my current series,
            Undesired Thrones,
            follows a diverse cast of ordinary citizens as they come face to face with a secret, growing oppression and
            must decide
            whether to save themselves, protect their loved ones, and achieve their own goals—or join together to fight
            back.</p>
        <p>Originally, from the coast of Maine, I’m now posted in the mountains of Colorado. I’m happiest when I’m
            outside, and
            most weekends you’ll find me camping in the back of my Tacoma, wandering the slopes of my vast
            backyard—probably
            thinking about writing, or with a book in hand. </p>
        <p>If you’d like to connect, please contact me via email or on Twitter. I’d love to hear from you!</p>
